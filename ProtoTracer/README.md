# **ProtoTracer: 3D Rendering and Animation Engine**
This project is a live 3D rendering and animation engine designed for use on microcontrollers.

## Demonstration:
As a quick way to showcase the capabilities of this software, here is a demo showing a live rendering of a rotating and textured .OBJ file:

## Recommended platform requirements:
* 32-bit FPU
* 200MHz+ processor
* At least 80KB dynamic memory
* Recommended Microcontrollers: Teensy 4.0/4.1

This codebase has been tested on an Arduino Mega (smaller .OBJ file with a 89 pixel matrix) and on a Teensy 4.0 (2000 triangle scene with a 2,804 pixel matrix).
